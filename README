To compute the 1D sod shock problem with 128 mesh grids,
issue the following command:

% ./make_plot.sh sod 128 

The image files of the results are created in a directory sod_128.

For other test cases, specify "lax" for the Lax's problem, "shu" for
the Shu's problem, and "blanc" for the Le Blanc's problem.
